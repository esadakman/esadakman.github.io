## Portfolio Page  
## Introduction

When I started learning software, I wanted to create my own portfolio website. I wanted it to showcase my experience, education, projects and skills. I wasn't that good at designing websites in the beginning and I was looking for a portfolio template to help me get started. And after great research I found Harvey Delaney's devportfolio template on Github.

I loved its design, simplicity and customizability - it had everything I wanted in a template. So I built my portfolio using the template that still lives here. 

Although the original project was created with Angular and Typescript,  as time went on I wanted to add to new things to the portfolio, I was restricted by how it was implemented. I found myself shoehorning new features into the project. So, I decided to create my own portfolio using a more modern stack: React, Javascript and Styled Components.

Harvey's portfolio template helped me so much to get started with creating my own portfolio - I hope that this template will provide the same benefit to you!

Although I created this template from scratch, it is useful to point out that the design of the website is heavily influenced by the template that Harvey has created.

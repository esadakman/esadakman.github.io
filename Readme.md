## Portfolio Page

## Introduction

When I first started learning software development, I wanted to create my own portfolio website to showcase my experience, education, projects, and skills. I wasn't very good at designing websites at the time, so I was looking for a portfolio template to help me get started.

After doing some research, I found Harvey Delaney's devportfolio template on GitHub. I loved its design, simplicity, and customizability, so I built my portfolio using that template.

Over time, I wanted to add new features to my portfolio, but I was limited by the way the original template was implemented. I found myself trying to force new features into the project, and I realized that I needed to create my own portfolio using a more modern stack.

That's why I created this portfolio template using React, JavaScript, and Styled Components. It's designed to be simple, customizable, and easy to use, and I hope it will provide the same benefit to you that Harvey's template provided to me.

Although I created this template from scratch, I must acknowledge that the design of the website is heavily influenced by Harvey's original template. Thank you, Harvey, for providing the inspiration for this project.
